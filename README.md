- In this project I made the main page's skeleton for the portfolio that will show all my future projects.
  This is the first milestone, and it is for mobile devices.
- For second milestone I added two more sections, called works and about me. Works section was built with CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- For third milestone I added form contact with my coding partner via "Pair Programming" session.
- For fourth milestone I create the desktop version frome the same code, making it responsive.
